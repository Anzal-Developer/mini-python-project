![Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock)  
*(A fun twist on the classic game, inspired by The Big Bang Theory! ðŸ––)*

## Description
This is a Python-based implementation of the expanded "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" game. It's a 6-round battle against the computer where you choose from 5 options: **rock**, **paper**, **scissors**, **lizard**, or **spock**. The game follows the unique winning rules:
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- Rock crushes Scissors

The first player to have more points after 6 rounds wins! Ties give points to both. Invalid inputs give the computer a free point.

Built with Python 3.x and the `random` library. No external dependencies needed.

## Features
- Interactive console-based gameplay
- Random computer opponent
- Detailed win/loss messages (e.g., "Scissors cuts paper! You Won!")
- Input validation (lowercase and stripped for ease)
- Final score summary and winner declaration
- Easy to extend (e.g., add more rounds or multiplayer)
